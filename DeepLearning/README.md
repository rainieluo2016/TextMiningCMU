# Deep Learning for Text Classification

Implementation of text classifiers using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to train word embeddings on large corpus and try to use the
pre-trained embeddings to improve the classification performance.

Framework: PyTorch

Text Preprocessing: NLTK
